    "text": "Hosting on Goggle Cloud Platform\nHosting on the GCP will require a service ticket, which can be accessed here\nTo request a new project you will need these items:\n1. Request type Create a new GCP project\n2. Research project name (they list the naming convention on the request)\n3. Billing information\n4. Environment (Development, staging, production)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis can be discussed with RIT before submission, if it’s not clear which to choose.\n\n\n5. User Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis is where you will list everyone that you want to have access to your project. The people listed here also need to have a GCP account.\n\n\nThere are two avenues for GCP hosted site: public and private. In both cases RIT needs to be contacted first and the instructions above need to be performed, however, you will need to know if you want a public or private website because they will need to set up your project differently to accomodate for the different levels of security.\nFor public sites:\nIf you want to host your site publicly then you will ask that RIT set up a project that can be seen publicly but remains private until you are ready. This means that until you are ready to share your site no one will have access. Once you are ready to make your site public contact RIT again and they will change the setting to public and the url will be:\nhttps://storage.googleapis.com/bucketname/index.html\nTo fill your project with your website you will do two things:\n\nCreate a bucket within the project.\nCopy over all of the material that is inside your _site folder but not the folder itself into the bucket.\nDone!\n\nFor private sites: Private sites are more complicated and take longer to set up (over a month!). Per RIT, “In general a Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) with a load balancer can do a private access to a GCP hosted site”. However, if a private site is absolutely needed then they are happy to do so. Once that is complete then you would follow the same steps as above. The only people than can access your private site are JAX employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn the cases of hosting on the carterdev server or privately on the GCP, no one outside of JAX will have access. This is something I have currently asked about to find options and solutions. Hosting publicly allows anyone with the url to see your website.",

Here, we’ll focus on a curated subset of the raw data in the package named `penguins`, which can serve as an out-of-the-box alternative to [`datasets::iris`](https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/iris.html).\n\n2.  The raw data, accessed from the [Environmental Data Initiative](https://environmentaldatainitiative.org/) (see full data citations below), is also available as [`palmerpenguins::penguins_raw`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins_raw.html).\n\nThe curated [`palmerpenguins::penguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) dataset contains 8 variables (n = 344 penguins). You can read more about the variables by typing [`?penguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html).\n\n## Culmen measurements\n\nWhat are culmen length & depth? The culmen is “the upper ridge of a bird’s beak” (definition from Oxford Languages). In the simplified `penguins` subset, culmen length and depth have been updated to variables named `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm`.\n\nFor this penguin data, the bill/culmen length and depth are measured as shown below (thanks Kristen Gorman for clarifying!):\n\n![Artwork by @allison_horst](culmen_depth.png)\n\n## Installation\n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\n\n```\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndata(package = 'palmerpenguins')\n```\n\n1.  load library\n2.  load palmerpenguin dataset\n\n## The Data\n\nThe [`palmerpenguins::penguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) data contains 333 complete cases, with 19 missing values.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nglimpse(penguins)\n```\n\nThe [`palmerpenguins::penguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) data contains 333 complete cases, with 19 missing values.\n\n```{r}\nvisdat::vis_dat(penguins)\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMake sure to create a global.R file with all of the packages needed for the website and to assign the data of interest.\n\n\nThis is the code that should be placed in the global.R file\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(tidyverse)    \ndata(package = 'palmerpenguins')\n\npenguins &lt;- penguins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you change code-fold to show then your code will default to visible but can be hidden still.
