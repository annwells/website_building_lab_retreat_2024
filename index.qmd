## Why should we build websites for data dissemination?

1. It's easier to talk with collaborators and share results in an intuitive way.

2. It's easier to understand the outcome of an experiment and organize data in a way that will be accessible years after the project is complete. 

3. The websites don't require traditional biologists to understand your code but empower them to understand the steps of analysis that have been taken to arrive at an outcome creating richer discussions. 

4. At the end of a project they can easily be publicly hosted for other researchers to investigate the entire analysis that was completed, not just what was presented in the accompanying journal article.
