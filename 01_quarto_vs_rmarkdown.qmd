## Quarto

Quarto is the new rmarkdown. It isn't much different as far as syntax, if you are familiar with Rmarkdown; however, Rmarkdown requires several packages to run and several packages to create different types of documents.

On the other hand, quarto is both agnostic and a singular package. This means that quarto does not require RStudio or R to run and can utilize files from multiple coding languages. Additionally, quarto only requires quarto to create multiple document types, streamlining the dissemination process.

Quarto also lets you organize your files into folders, which allows for better organization of different data analyses within a project while Rmarkdown required all .rmd files be placed in the primary directory.

Rmarkdown will be maintained indefinitely; however, no new features will be developed. Quarto is the new documentation package and will continue to be developed and improved upon for the foreseeable future. All feature requests can be made [here](https://github.com/quarto-dev) and documentation for current features can be found [here](https://quarto.org)
